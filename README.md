# Invoice-Tool
**Invoice Tool** is a secure, browser-based tool designed to streamline the processing and archiving of electronic invoices for reimbursement.

1. **Smart Merging & Layout**:
  
  - Combines multiple invoice files into a single A4 PDF for easy printing.
    
  - **Intelligent Layout**:
    Automatically fits two horizontal invoices on one page (top/bottom), 
    while vertical invoices (like HSR tickets) are placed on individual 
    pages.
    
  - **Print Aids**: Draws dotted cutting lines and allows customizable page margins.
    
2. **Format Support & Pre-processing**:
  
  - Supports mixed input of **PDF**, **JPG**, and **PNG** files.
    
  - **Auto-Correction**: Automatically rotates vertical images.
    
3. **Data Extraction & Batch Renaming**:
  
  - Uses a local engine to extract key data: **Invoice Number**, **Amount**, **Seller**, and **Item Name**.
    
  - **Batch Renaming**: One-click to rename all files to a standard format (e.g., "Seller-Item-Amount-No") and download them as a ZIP archive.
    
  - **Data Export**: Exports extracted invoice details to a text file for easy verification.
    
4. **Privacy First**:
  
  - 100% client-side processing. **No files are ever uploaded to any server**, ensuring your financial data remains completely private and secure.
